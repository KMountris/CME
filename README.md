# CME

Cell-based Maximum Entropy (CME) approximants for 2-/3-D meshless simulations.

This software is a naive implementation of the CME approximants in 2-/3-D domains aiming to allow the user to generate and store in a file the CME approximants so she could import it to her meshless simulation software.

## Version
cme-1.0.0

## Getting Started

Simply clone or download this repository and execute the run_main.m script with MATLAB.

### Prerequisites

[MathWorks](https://es.mathworks.com/) MATLAB v2016a or later
